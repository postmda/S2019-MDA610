### Assignment 7 (due April 2)
1. Read the following topics in [Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php)
  - Interactive Shell
  - Sequential Data types: Lists and Strings
  - Input Via the Keyboard
  - Conditional Statements
  - Loops, While Loops
  - For Loops
  - Output with Print
2. Take Quiz 6 on Blackboard.
3. Create a Jupyter notebook. Write a Python code snippet in a code cell for each of the following problem. Use Markdown cells and comments to add necessary notes and text.  
	1. Ask the user to input a numeric grade. Then output the corresponding letter grade. The grade scale is as follows: 90 - 100 A; 80 - 89 B; 70 - 79 C; 60 - 69 D; 0 - 59 F.
	2. For two given lists, construct a new list that contains the elements common to both lists.
	3. A string is parlindrome if reverse of the string is same as the string. For example, 'abba' is parlindrome, while 'abbb' is not. Write a function to check if a string is parlindrome. The string is passed as an argument to the function. The function returns True if the string is parlindrome, or False otherwise. 
	4. Print the numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where all three digits of a number are even. The numbers printed out are separated by commas. (Hint: ```x // 1 % 10```, ```x // 10 % 10```, and ```x // 100 % 10``` return, respectively, the units digit, the 10s digit and the 100s digit of a number x.) 
	5. Write a function to count occurrences of each distinct character in a given string. The string is passed to the function as an argument. The function returns a dictionary with each character being the key of an item, and its frequency being the value of the item. 
5. Upload the Jupyter notebook you created above to a folder in your GitHub repository. Email the instructor the path of the folder and the notebook name.  
6. Read an article on [The 7 Deadly Sins of Programming](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-deadly-sins-of-programming-a7574efc639f).
