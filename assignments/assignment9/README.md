### Assignment 9 (due April 16)
1. Review MySQL and Python. 
2. Take Quiz 8 on Blackboard.
3. Create a Jupyter notebook. Write a Python code snippet in a code cell for each of the following problems. Use Markdown cells and comments to add necessary notes and text.  
	1. Write a function to compute the mean, (sample) variance and (sample) standard deviation of a list of floating-point numbers passed to the function. The function returns a dictionary that maps a set of keys to the above descriptive statistic values. Hints: a. use the len function; b. apply the sample variance and sample standard deviation formulas in statistics.
	2. Write a function to compute the mean of a series of numbers entered by the user. The user is allowed to input as many numbers as she/he wants. After the user enters "stop" instead of a number, the function computes and returns the mean value. Hint: use the append function. 
4. Upload the Jupyter notebook you created above to a folder in your GitHub repository. Email the instructor the path of the folder and the notebook name.
